# 2024-12-19 OCR API Session Log

## Project Overview:
- OCR API built with FastAPI
- Uses pytesseract for text extraction
- Current dependencies: FastAPI, uvicorn, python-multipart, pytesseract, Pillow

## Current Project Structure:
```
ocr-api/
├── main.py
├── requirements.txt
└── 2024-12-19-session-log.md (this file)
```

## What We're Working On:
- Setting up session log system for better context management
- Reviewed existing OCR API implementation

## Files Modified Today:
- Created: 2024-12-19-session-log.md
- Modified: main.py (added cross-platform Tesseract support)

## Current Status:
- ✅ Session logging system set up
- ✅ Reviewed main.py - OCR API implementation
- ✅ Dependencies installed successfully
- ✅ API running on port 8000
- ✅ API tested and working correctly
- ✅ Health endpoint responding at localhost:8000/health
- ✅ Interactive docs available at localhost:8000/docs

## Current Implementation Analysis:
- FastAPI app with single `/upload` endpoint
- Handles JPG/PNG files up to 10MB
- Uses pytesseract for OCR processing
- Has CORS middleware enabled
- Includes proper error handling and validation

## Next Steps:
- Install Python (required)
- Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
- Run API: python main.py
- Test with curl commands
- [Add more as we progress]

## Code Snippets/Commands Used:
```cmd
# Install dependencies
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the API
python main.py

# Test health endpoint
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# Test upload endpoint
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/upload" -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" -F "file=@test_image.png"
```

## Notes:
- Using Amazon Q file reference system (@filename) for context
- Session logs help maintain continuity across chat sessions
